PCT is a command-line based tool, so it can be run in batch mode, to generate nightly builds or for continuous integration. However, as PCT is a set of ANT tasks, your compilation tasks can be run using a graphical frontend to ANT.\r\n\r\nPCT was designed and written by Gilles QUERRET (g.querret at gmail.com), freelance developer for Riverside Software in France. \r\n\r\n### Documentation ###\r\n\r\nDocumentation is available [here](https://github.com/jakejustus/pct/wiki)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
